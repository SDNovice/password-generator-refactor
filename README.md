# password-generator-refactor

## Description

I was tasked with refactoring a random password generator website.
In regards to the original code it lacked a number of arrays which
I added. It also add no for loop or actual prompts for the user to 
interact with or to actually develop the the password. The purpose 
for the site itself is to allow users to select attributes that
will help specify what the password will contain. First the length
will be prompted and will have a limit between 8 - 128. Then promted
with a list of critetias if none are chosen undefine will be present.

To use this just click the generate button, add your desire length
then select if you want either lowercase, uppercase, numerics, and/or
special characters.
